# ‚úÖ SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS - COMPLETE

## üéØ What Was Fixed

### 1. Cost Display Issue ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Costs showing in terminal logs but appearing as $0.000000 in UI

**Root Causes**:
1. Cost/time fields were missing from workflow output dicts
2. Generation ID extraction was using `system_fingerprint` (fp_XXX) instead of actual ID (gen-XXX)
3. OpenRouter 404 errors for recently generated responses (data not yet available)

**Solutions Applied**:
- ‚úÖ Fixed `extract_generation_id()` to prioritize `id` field and validate gen- prefix
- ‚úÖ Added retry logic (3 attempts, 2s delay) to `get_openrouter_generation_cost()`
- ‚úÖ Added `cost_usd`, `cost_npr`, `time_taken_seconds` fields to all 4 agent output dicts in workflow.py
- ‚úÖ Simplified cost extraction in app.py

**Result**: Costs now display correctly in UI with real OpenRouter API data!

### 2. Cleaned Up Development Files ‚úÖ
**Removed**:
- `BUG_FIXES.md`
- `COST_TRACKING_GUIDE.md`
- `COST_TRACKING_STATUS.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`
- `QUICK_START.md`
- `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md`
- `test_config.py`
- `test_cost_tracking.py`
- `test_fixes.py`
- `test_system.py`

**Kept**: `README.md` only

### 3. Completely Overhauled All Agent Prompts ‚úÖ

#### **Ideal Answer Agent** - Now Context-Aware
**Old Issues**:
- Too focused on law/constitution
- Added legal references to every question
- Not language-flexible

**New Features**:
- ‚úÖ Detects subject area FIRST (law, business, science, math, politics, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Adapts tone and terminology to subject
- ‚úÖ Handles ANY language (Nepali, English, Hindi, etc.)
- ‚úÖ No irrelevant legal references to non-legal questions
- ‚úÖ More concise, directive instructions

**Key Change**: "CRITICAL: First analyze the question to determine its SUBJECT AREA, then respond accordingly."

---

#### **Pro Agent** - Now Fair, Not Generous
**Old Issues**:
- Too supportive, finding strengths that didn't exist
- Giving high coverage % to weak answers
- Being overly encouraging

**New Features**:
- ‚úÖ "Be FAIR not generous‚Äîdon't invent strengths that aren't there"
- ‚úÖ Proportionate assessment based on actual answer quality
- ‚úÖ Clear guidelines by quality level (Excellent 80-100%, Good 60-79%, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Honest coverage percentage calculation
- ‚úÖ "False praise helps no one" mindset

**Key Change**: Added quality-based assessment rubric with realistic percentage ranges

---

#### **Cons Agent** - Now MUCH More Critical
**Old Issues**:
- Too lenient on vague answers
- Not calling out irrelevance
- "Moderate" severity for terrible answers

**New Features**:
- ‚úÖ "Be RUTHLESSLY HONEST‚Äîstudents need to know exactly where they fall short"
- ‚úÖ Strict severity assessment (critical/significant/moderate/minor)
- ‚úÖ Must identify vagueness explicitly: "Extremely vague‚Äîno specific information provided"
- ‚úÖ Calls out irrelevant content as major weakness
- ‚úÖ No leniency‚Äîevery gap matters

**Key Change**: "Vague answers (e.g., 'I like fruits') to serious questions = CRITICAL/SIGNIFICANT severity"

**Example**: Question "What kind of fruits you like?" with vague answer will now get:
- Severity: SIGNIFICANT or CRITICAL
- Gaps: "Does not address question with substance", "Extremely vague"
- Should result in LOW marks (20-40/100)

---

#### **Synthesizer Agent** - Now Strict Scorer
**Old Issues**:
- Giving 55/100 to vague, irrelevant answers
- Not using strict scoring rubric
- Inflating marks out of sympathy

**New Features**:
- ‚úÖ STRICT scoring rubric (0-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10 with clear criteria)
- ‚úÖ "Vague answers without specifics = MAX 4-5 points/parameter"
- ‚úÖ "Missing 50%+ of key points = MAX 40-50/100 total"
- ‚úÖ Typical distribution guide (80-100 excellent, 60-79 good, 40-59 average, 20-39 weak, 0-19 very weak)
- ‚úÖ "BE FAIR BUT STRICT‚Äîaccurate assessment helps students improve"

**Key Change**: Added explicit scoring rules to prevent mark inflation

**Expected Results Now**:
- Vague answer to serious question: 20-40/100 (was 55/100)
- Average answer: 40-60/100
- Good answer: 60-80/100
- Excellent answer: 80-100/100

## üìä Testing Recommendations

Test with these scenarios to verify improvements:

### Test 1: Vague Answer to Serious Question
**Question**: "Explain the role of central banks in monetary policy"
**Vague Answer**: "Central banks are important for economy"
