## ❓ Troubleshooting

### App Not Building?

**Check logs in "Logs" tab**

Common fixes:
- Missing package in `requirements.txt`
- API keys not set correctly
- Wrong SDK (should be Gradio)

### "Runtime Error"?

**Check**:
1. API keys are set (Settings → Repository secrets)
2. Logs for specific error
3. Try "Factory reboot" (Settings → Factory reboot)

### App is Slow?

- Free CPU is slower than local
- Consider GPU upgrade ($0.60/hr) if needed
- Or optimize models (use GPT-3.5 instead of GPT-4)

---

## 📊 Monitor Your App

### Check Usage

- Space page shows view count
- OpenRouter dashboard shows API costs: https://openrouter.ai/activity

### Set Spending Limits

In OpenRouter:
1. Go to Settings
2. Set monthly limit (e.g., $10/month)
3. Get email alerts when approaching limit

---

## 💰 Costs

### Hosting: $0/month (FREE on Hugging Face)

### API Costs:
- ~$0.002 per evaluation
- If 100 people use it/day = $6/month
- If 1000 people use it/day = $60/month

**Tip**: Start with rate limiting (max 10 evaluations per user per day)
